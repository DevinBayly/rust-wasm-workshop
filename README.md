# Rust and WebAssembly Workshop

## Setup

### Rust Toolchain

If you don't have `rustup` installed yet, run:

    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

Next, use `rustup` to install the latest nightly and the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:

    rustup component add nightly
    rustup update nightly
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly

### Node and `npm` Toolchain

I recommend using https://github.com/creationix/nvm to manage side-by-side
installations of different node versions, but if you already have node >= 8
installed, you can skip this.

    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    nvm install 9
    nvm use 9
